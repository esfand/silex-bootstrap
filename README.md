silex-bootstrap
===============

A Silex bundle with Twitter Bootstrap and a basic directory structure. 

Instructions for Pagoda users:

For installing as an app at Pagoda Box, you can use this Quick Start: https://pagodabox.com/cafe/erikaheidi/silex-bootstrap

Just run the “Launch” button and it will create the app. If you are not logged in yet, it will ask you to login (or register). And then this newly-created launch will go to your dashboard as a regular Pagoda Box application.

Instruction for non-Pagoda users:

Just clone the GIT repo and delete the “BoxFile” file since you are not going to need it.

Repo: https://github.com/erikaheidi/silex-bootstrap

After cloning the repo, you must perform a:

php composer.phar install

To install the dependencies.
